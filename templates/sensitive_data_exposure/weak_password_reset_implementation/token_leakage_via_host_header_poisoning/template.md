## Remediation Advice

If the web application makes use of the host header value when composing the reset link, an attacker can poison the password reset link that is sent to a victim. If the victim clicks on the poisoned reset link in the email, the attacker will obtain the password reset token and can go ahead and reset the victimâ€™s password. To protect your systems from this type of attack never trust the host header as it is controlled by the users.
